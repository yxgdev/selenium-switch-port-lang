# Selenium Script for Button Hover and Language Switch

This script uses Selenium to switch language on my Portfolio site

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library (`pip install selenium`)
- WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver) s

## Usage

1. Replace the placeholders in the script (`lang.py`) with the appropriate locators, button IDs, and language selection options for your webpage.
2. Set the path to your WebDriver in the script.
3. Run the script: `python switch-lang.py`.

The script will open a browser, navigate to the webpage, hover over the language button, and switch the language by selecting the desired option.
